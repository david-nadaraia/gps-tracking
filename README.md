# Assets GPS Tracking Serverless Architecture

A serverless solution for assets GPS tracking based on AWS IoT infrastructure, and MapBox GL.

Architecture was inspired by [this blog post](https://www.mapbox.com/solutions/asset-tracking) and was fundamentally re-worked to be based on [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk) infrastructure as code framework.
